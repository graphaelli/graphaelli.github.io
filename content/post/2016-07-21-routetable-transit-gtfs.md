title: Routetable - transit scheduling with GTFS

I put together as a little [project](https://github.com/graphaelli/routetable) to get to know the
[General Transit Feed Specification](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) and address some of the issues I have
with Google's otherwise excellent transit routing.  First, I'm willing to walk pretty far to a transit stop.  Second, I
want to see more options at one time.  Finally, I want a hard limit on transfers (Google does provide a less transfers
preference).  I also really wanted to show off my amazing UX skills.

If you share the pleasure of riding SEPTA, you may find [http://g.raphaelli.com/rt/](/rt/) helpful for planning your
next commute.
