Gil Raphaelli

I'm a software developer with [Elastic](http://elastic.co/) living just outside of Philadelphia, PA.

I can be reached g [at] raphaelli.com, /graphaelli on most services like [github](https://github.com/graphaelli) and
[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/graphaelli), and gilad on freenode.

If you're curious about what I was into in 2009, check out the [internet archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20130528211756/http://g.raphaelli.com:80/).
